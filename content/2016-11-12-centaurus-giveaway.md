Title: Free Lumens for Centaurus Users
Date: 2016-11-12 19:20
Category: Financial Inclusion

## Motivation
Centaurus was the first wallet application for Stellar.
It is conceived in the spirit of the [Stellar mission](https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/)
to *expand financial access and literacy worldwide*.

It's [open source](https://github.com/TbLtzk/Centaurus), 
free of charge,
[available for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.xcoins.centaurus)
and has small apk size for regions with low and/or expensive bandwidth

The wallet has been **[recently awarded](https://www.stellar.org/blog/build-winners-fa16/) in the centaurus build challenge**.
I feel really honored by this award and I would like to pass a bit of the reward to **YOU** - the current and future users of the Centaurus Wallet!

## Who will get Lumens (XLM)
I haven't decided on the exact distribution criteria, and there is still some development to do.
It will *NOT* be sufficient to download the app.
For technical reasons your account will need roughly 100 Lumens in the app to be eligible.
While none of the below criteria is a guarantee, you can increase your chances by following those principles:

* If you already have Lumens, be generous! 
* Tell your friends and help them to get over the 100 Lumen threshold!
* Donate to Centaurus to keep the programm running:  *GDJXQYEWDPGYK4LGCLFEV6HBIW3M22IK6NN2WQONHP3ELH6HINIKBVY7*
* Use the latest version of Centaurus.

## Do I have to apply for the giveaway?
No, the Lumens will be directly transferred to your Centaurus wallet.
And rather than a single payout per account, I'll try to distribute on a weekly or at least monthly base over a longer period of time.
This will give chance to new users to jump on, while rewarding existing users again and again.
And it gives me the chance to adapt the programm if necessary for its spirit:
**Make Lumen an evenly and fairly distributed global currency!**

## How to get started
As mentioned above, your account will need some Lumens to be eligible for the giveaway.
The easiest way is to ask a friend, who already has lumens, to help you out.
With the help of the giveaway, you'll probably soon be able to pay him back if you don't want to sponge him off.
If nobody around you has Lumens, then YOU should be the seed!
Go to the Stellar [Info about Lumen](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/), especially read the section on where to get Lumens.
Create an account on one of the mentioned exchanges and get some Lumens for you and for those around you!

## Disclaimer
I'm doing all this in my spare time, and in a manner of best effort!

* There is no guarantee on whether or not, or how much Lumens you will receive.
* It may happen that you wrongfully don't get anything. I'm already sorry, if that happens, but please don't contact me for investigation.
* The programm may be stopped or changed anytime for any reason, but especially if it seems to be abused.
